## 4 - A brief reflection on the use cases, benefits, and limitations of serverless functions 
Serverless functions, or Function as a Service (FaaS), provide a scalable way to build applications without managing infrastructure. They excel in microservices, event-driven architectures, RESTful APIs, scheduled tasks, and data processing. Key benefits include cost efficiency—paying only for compute time—automatic scalability, reduced management overhead, faster deployment, and built-in redundancy. However, limitations such as cold start latency, execution time limits, the need for external state management, potential vendor lock-in, and debugging challenges must be considered. While serverless functions can enhance application development, it's crucial to balance them with other architectural patterns for optimal results.
